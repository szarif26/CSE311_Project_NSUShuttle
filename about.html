    <h3 class=" text-center text-white">As the number of cases and the fatality rate of the coronavirus decreases, everything starts to reopen and go back to the usual routines prior to the pandemic. In doing so, a few problems arise like the transportation problem. Many students who enrol in North South university come from various districts outside Dhaka City, which is why when they move to Dhaka, they are compelled to use public transport like bus and CNG Taxis, while some use apps like Uber, Pathao etc. During rainy weather, it becomes difficult to find taxis and Uber cars, the price also increases under such circumstances. As a result, students and faculties might be late for class. This is also true for those who do not own any personal vehicle and also face the same issue.</h3>
    <br></br>
    <h3 class=" text-center text-white">This Service has been designed to provide a solution for the aforementioned problem. It aims to make it easier for students and faculties to attend their classes without having to worry about the next dayâ€™s mode of transport. The NSU Shuttle Service provides all the information required such as bus routes, the arrival and departure timings of the shuttle all and many other in one place.</h3>
    <br></br>
    <h3 class=" text-center text-white">If a person wants to access this software, all they have to do is create an account using their NSU ID and Password and log-in in the same way they log into the NSU RDS. This procedure is the same for all the students, faculty and staff, who want to use the service. As soon as the person logs in, they will be able to see all the routes and all the related information. After that, the user can select their preferred route and time. And finally book a seat for a safe travel.</h3>
